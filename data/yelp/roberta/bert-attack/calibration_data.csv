Our tables were delivered to our spot and a couple questions about the menu were asked. but few soon after that a woman came over and suggested ours if we just sat ourselves. We yes did because there was an open restaurant on the patio, no sign, and no many had known us as we stepped up to the patio. us didn't worry about it as we did not see anyone standing and it's a pizza place. no we were wrong.

Such a wonderful experience for my 3.5 year old son and Mom!!! We tried two other dentist prior to this office and had not so great experiences.
