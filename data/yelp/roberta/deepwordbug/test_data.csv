Crispy cream and Dunkin can suck it!,Lamars donuts came very highly recommended by a coworker so my boss brought some to the office for everyone to try. My favorite got-o donut is the Boston Cream so I decided to sample that one first. It was good but tasted like a Boston Cream donut from just about anywhere else. It wasn't until after I tried the Boston Cream that I was told about how the chocolate glazed were the real special ones. So I gave that one a sho and OWW.... it actually was very very gojd and dare I say outstanOding. Crisy cream and Duknin can suck it!,test
