"We came here due to the declining service of our local Olive Garden. The food here was absolutely delicious. The fried calamari was well seasoned and the manicotti was to die for.\n\nThat being said, the service was well under par. The waitress was nice enough but came to the table few and far between. When she brought us wine, she gave us two glasses and said the other was dirty. Perhaps that should have been checked before being brought out?
