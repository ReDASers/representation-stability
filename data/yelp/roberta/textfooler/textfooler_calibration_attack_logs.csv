After visiting a different Brazilian restaurant in Charlotte with terrible service i was really hoping this [[would]] be better. [[Boy]] what a night and day difference. [[This]] place has [[amazing]] service! The owner stopped by our table to thank us and check on us. Our server was extremely attentive, the food was delicious and kept coming all night. They made my birthday a very special occasion. \[[n]]\nI visited again last week and it was just as [[good]] if not better than the [[first]] time!! [[Keep]] up the good work :)!!","I have visited this restaurant on two occasions. The [[initial]] was with a party of 8 for my birthday.

"Mike Ingersoll is a damn [[good]] yankee, no disrespect. [[I]] [[love]] grabbing a hearty sandwich from here for a late weekend lunch. The restaurant has moved around a few times over the years, but the quality of the food has [[never]] [[diminished]], it has only improved. \n\nMr. Ingersoll has run the restaurant for a good long time and he can [[really]] [[hold]] down a tight kitchen family that [[works]] [[together]] like a [[well]] (olive) oiled machine. [[Unlike]] a [[lot]] of delis, this place doesn't really draw a lot of [[drinkers]], so it is a [[clean]] environment to bring the family","Mike Ingersoll is a damn [[alright]] yankee, no disrespect.
