My wife and I tried this restaurant after reading the reviews on Yelp. We were both raised in SoCal and wanted to try the carne asada.

"Great place to get fast healthy food, but I do hate how all the bowls are the same price. We ordered the Toyko Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. The Tokyo Bay was worth the $10 because it was delicious, fulfilling, and had salmon. The Gulf of Mexico was just an overpriced Spinach salad and it was bland. My advice is to read the ingredients carefully and make sure you're getting your money's worth!","Grea place to get fast healthy food, but I do hate how all the bowls are the same price.

So they're pretty friendly at this location.. They just rush you I'm sorry I don't have the menu memorized and sometimes I like to try new mixes. I asked the girl closing my bowl if the bowls got smaller she laughed and said not really. Then everyone in the prep line said no ma'am our bowls are the same size (like they're coached to say this ) I could barely see the rice and they drizzled on the sour cream. It was at That moment I wouldn't dare ask to add my avocado in fear they'd charge me a dollar for a corner spoon. P,Po theypre pretty friendly at this location..

"Not sure how to calculate the star rating on this. So, I'd write this up first before I click the star rating. The Las Vegas weather was in the 80s when we arrived. For a four-star hotel (I was told that it was), I expected too much when it comes to the rooms they offered. I was totally disappointed when the airconditioning inside our Club Tower room was not working. The lowest we could have was 60*F and there was no cold air blowing. The fan blowed out hot air. An aircondition system is a big factor for me when it comes to hotels.","Not sure how to calculate the star rating on this. So, I'd write this up first before I click the star rating.
