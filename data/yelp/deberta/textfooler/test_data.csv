"Nice cozy restaurant on Spring Mountain Rd, a little west of the old SF market but before Lindell. It took over the same location from 2010 Fusion Restaurant.\n\nCafe de Japon is a very Nippon atmosphere, just like Philip T mentioned in his review. Perhaps because the ladies working in the front are both Japanese, the outfits they wore, and even how the dishes are presented and served all reminded me of my previous visits to Tokyo.

"I have been practicing yoga for a few years and i was ready to find extensive training. I first called a different studio to take the teacher training course and I was, surprisingly, ignored. I then called Angelica Govaert at Sin City Yoga and was greeted with all the kindness and excitement in the world. Since I have been at the studio, I have felt nothing less than pure, love, help, and wisdom from everyone there. Angelica has worked so hard to bring people together in the Yoga community and her efforts have paid off. Her studio is the best I've ever been to. Everyone is so friendly and helpful.","I have been practicing yoga for a few years and i was ready to find extensive training.

"The food is ok, not good, certainly not great. One must wait in a ridiculous line to pay, in another to be seated, another to eat seafood, then another to eat meat. You can pay an additional $15 to skip the first line (it's worth it). With the additional $15 the buffet is $65 + drinks.
