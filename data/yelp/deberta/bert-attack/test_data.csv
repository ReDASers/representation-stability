I ordered the hot wings-half buffalo half thai-disgusting. Worst wings I have ever had. My friends had the burgers and they liked them-so if you end up here don't order what I had. My other friend ordered the Sunday flatbread special-they forgot the bacon,I'm sorry but everything from the drinks to the appetizer to the feast was so great I wanted to send everything back. I tried the Peachy Keen drink-yuk...had the calamari appetizer with Panko crust-ummm I guess it was wrong at first. The crust was too thick and you could barely taste the calamari.

Went here last and have to say it was below expectations I think Gordon Ramsey would have. They sat us we ordered an appetizer they brought it out and started giving it to the table next to us.

The food is marginal for an all you can eat type of restaurant. Don't expect anything authentic but if you're really hungry then it might just be the right thing to hold you up. Certain items are better than others. Sashimi is not too fresh but entrees are ok. Sushi rice is too warm. Good and relaxing atmosphere but the staff seem to hate their jobs. If you have been here recently and rated anything higher than a 2 star then you really need to go out and try more stuff. I do not apply relativeness in my reviews so the disadvantages of being in Waterloo has no effect on my rating.,The restaurant is not for an all you can eat type of restaurant.

I don't think I'll be shopping here anytime soon. I bought two very nice shirts that I was only able to wear once! I was very disappointed. The day I bought the shirts I washed them and then wore them later that week. As I was wearing the shirt all of a sudden the beads on my shirt started falling. I tried to stop it but the string they were on just kept coming undone the more I tried fixing it. I ended up just taking the shirt off. The same thing happened with the other shirt as well.
