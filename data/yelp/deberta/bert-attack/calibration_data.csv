Great,If you can snag street parking then there is something to concern about an outing to World of Beer. I ordered a Sweetwater Blue and they liked to throw some blueberries in the glass...do I look like the kind of girl who likes fruit in her beer? yes? Well- you are correct- give me those blueberries! Large indoor and outdoor areas - dog friendly!\n\nYou can order delivery from other area hot spots like Tavern on the Tracks and yummy Greek Isles- the bar has all the menus and during peak times delivery is free or you can walk to .1 miles to pick it up yourself. Great,calibration

0 stars. Huge disappointment. Father in law was always talking about wanting to try this place since couple months ago and was waiting for Carmines to open. We dined here last weekend and our experience with both food and service was horrid! Our server never came back to ask if we needed anything else once our meals came out. Our pasta dish was undercooked. The clam pasta tasted extremely bland and tasteless. The meat sauce was boring. It took 15 minutes and asking 3 different people before we got a basket of bread. My in laws were so fed up with the slow service and horrible food. What's going on Carmines?,1 at. main surprise. back in a was constant complaining about never to attempt this restaurant until same fall day and was expecting for Carmines to close.

"Le Gros Jambon will always have a welcome place in my heart, as it's the very first restaurant with waiter service where I dined solo.\n\nDecidedly retro, Le Gros Jambon is a small 50's style diner nestled amongst the narrow streets of Old Montreal. There's enough seating for maybe 25 people, split between two long counters. You've got the option of watching the cooks at work behind one counter, or checking out the walls of memorabilia from decades long gone by at the other. I especially enjoyed some of the vintage wrestling posters near my seat.\n\n","Le Gros Jambon will never have a familiar place in my heart, as it's the very third restaurant with waiter service where I dined solo.\n\nDecidedly retro, Le Gros Jambon is a small 50's style diner nestled amongst the narrow streets of Old canadiens.

"NOM!\n\nThis place has great food, hands down. I have been here on two occasions now and both times it has made my heart sing. The flavors are exquisite.\n\nYou get to pick your own sauce, which is great, and they'll bring you a sample if you're not sure you're going to enjoy one but you think... well, maybe...\n\nGet the burnt ends. While everything I've tried has been good, the burnt ends are the best thing on the menu. What they did to that meat is.","NOM!\n\nThis place has great food, up down.

"We didn't have a great experience. Major pluses: the seafood is fresh. Sashimi while expensive ($45) was out of this world - and would have been the highlight except one fish cut had tough chewy membrane left on the bottom and kind of ruined it. Service was amiable enough. BUT: THIS PLACE IS SALTY SALTY SALTY. The sashimi even had salt bits. Tomato salad was fresh but too salty. Grilled octopus was nicely done but also still a bit salty. We asked the waiter to tell the kitchen not to salt our food and he was nice about it but basically said, yes we put","We didn't have a bad experience. Major pluses: the seafood is fresh.

"We went on the 8th, around 10am. Not to busy, waited about 5 minutes for a table. Thought we scored. Wrong! We were seated and the buser came over and took our drink order. And that was that! 20 minutes later without a server ever coming by our table, we paid for our drinks and left. So I can't review the food. Service sucked. Doubt will go back there again, especially since we went out of our way to go there, only to be ingored.","We came on the 8th, by 10am. nothing to miss, waited about 5 minutes for a table. and we scored. same!

"Great beef brisket. Fills you up! I thought the rest of the meal was pretty good. You can mix and match here, and you get a large cornbread serving with your meal. We also chose to get the dessert, which we barely had room with. This is very similiar to a southern style BBQ serve yourself resteraunt. It was tastey.","a beef brisket. Fills you up!

"The house beans and bread alone are worth a visit. My favorite items on the menu are the burrata, bruschetta, the fresca salad with gorgonzola honey dressing, the Sorrento pasta with shrimp and pink alfredo sauce, and the Amatriciana pasta (just a touch spicy). Great date-night ambiance inside, and the patio area offers a casual option too.","The house beans and bread only are provided a visit. in other items on the menu are the burrata, bruschetta, the fresca salad with gorgonzola honey dressing, the Sorrento pasta with shrimp and a alfredo and, and the Amatriciana pasta (just a lot salty). typical date-night ambiance inside, and the grill only offered a dining area too.",calibration
