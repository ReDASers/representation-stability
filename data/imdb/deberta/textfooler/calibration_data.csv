"I just read a review defending this film because it had a low budget, now my take on things.<br /><br />The CGI monsters was reasonable well animated but was implemented in the worst possible way. The fight scenes weren't even fights it was just one shot of an actor then one shot of monster with very interaction at all. When the monster did interact it looked like it was done in paintshop pro. In my opinion if you have a low budget you should use models and puppets. They may not look as fancy but at least they interact, just look at Peter Jacksons early films.<","I just leen a review defending this film because it had a low budgeted, now my take on things.<br /><br />The CGI monsters was judicious well emboldened but was executed in the trickiest achievable manner.

"The Matador is better upon reflection because at the time one is watching it, it seems so light. The humor is always medium-gauge, never unfunny but never gut-busting.

Van Dyke, who only had a decent career in the 1960s, never was much of an actor at all (by his own admission) and he was already far too old to play a doctor when the series began in 1993.","Only a hokey rip-off of the vastly better ""Murder, She Wrote"", it is perfectly amazing that this poorly-written refusing carried for a fullest eight age.
