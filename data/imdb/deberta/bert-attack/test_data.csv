Stillness is good. But this film though was just not slow.<br /><br />Credit must go to the two main actors.

"I haven't seen all of Jess Franco's movies, I have seen 5, I think, and there are more than 180 of them. So maybe it's a bit early to say so but ""Necronomicon Geträumte Sünden"" (better known as 'Succubus', but that is the cut version) is according to me if not the best, certainly on of Franco's best. Franco is best known (although 'known' might be slightly exaggerated) for ""Vampiros Lesbos"", a weird cultish movie that got more acclaim in the mid 90","I haven't seen all of Jess Franco's movies, I have seen 5, I think, and there are more than 180 of them.

"On this 4th of July weekend it's heartening to see the spirit of the Declaration of Independence alive and well in the film ""War, Inc.""
